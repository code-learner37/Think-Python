- n = 42 is legal, but 42 = n is not. You can't assign variables to numbers.

1. The volume of a sphere with radius 5 = (4/3) * math.pi * r **3 = 523.599
2. The total wholesale cost =  24.95 * 0.6 * 60 + 3 + 0.75 * 59 = 945.450
3. The time for breakfast = (6 + 52/60) + (8/60 + 15/3600) + 3 * (7/60 + 12 /3600) + (8/60 + 15/3600) 
   = 7+ 30/60 + 3/3600 = 7'30'3
